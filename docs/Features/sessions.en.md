# Sessions

Meetings, physical or virtual, between two or more users are called **"Sessions"**. There are a few types of sessions:

## Physical Session

**Physical Sessions** are meetings between two or more users in real life, physically. Users are required to scan a QR code to start a physical session. This is to prevent sessions between wrong users.

??? question "How do I scan the QR code?"

    For more info on QR codes, please check out [starting a session as an explorer](../Getting_Started/Exploring_Expressions/having_session.en.md#starting-the-session) and [starting a session as an expresser](../Getting_Started/Expressing_Yourself/having_session.en.md#starting-the-session)

## Virtual Session

**Virtual Sessions** are online meetings between two or more users. Basically video-calls. Users are not required to scan a QR code to start the session.

## Multi-expresser Session

**Multi-expresser Sessions** are meetings between one [explorer](user_modes.en.md#explorer) and multiple [expressers](user_modes.en.md#expresser).

## Multi-explorer Session

**Multi-explorer Sessions** are sessions with two or more explorers. Not all sessions can be multi-explorer, as it is up to the [expresser](user_modes.en.md#expresser) to enable/disable multi-explorer for an [expression](../Getting_Started/Expressing_Yourself/expressions.en.md).
