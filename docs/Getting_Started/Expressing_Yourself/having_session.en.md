# Having A Session

## Pre-session

After you have accepted an [instant](requests.en.md#instant-requests)/[booking request](requests.en.md#booking-requests), the pre-session screen will show up. Form this screen you will be able to do the following:

### Navigating

You can navigate to the location of the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) by tapping the **"Navigate :material-navigation-outline:"** button. It will launch your default navigation app, *such as Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps*, to navigate to the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer)'s location.

### Communicating

You can chat with the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) by tapping the **:material-chat-processing:** icon.

### Starting The Session

In order to prevent starting your session with the wrong people, a QR code scan is required to start the session; you can do one of the following:

#### Scan The Explorer's QR Code

The [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) will [show you the qr code on their device](../Exploring_Expressions/having_session.en.md#let-the-explorer-scan-your-qr-code). Tap on the **"Scan QR Code"** button to scan the QR code.

#### Let The Explorer Scan Your QR Code

Tap on the **"Show QR Code"** button to show the QR code to the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer), and let them [scan it](../Exploring_Expressions/having_session.en.md#scan-the-expressers-qr-code).

### Cancelling The Session

To cancel the session, tap on the **"Cancel Session"** button, and then select or enter the reason of cancellation.

## During The Session

### Donating

You can donate to charities and organizations by:

1. Select or type the amount you would like to donate
2. Tap the **"Donate"** button
3. Select a charity or an organization

???+ question "How much of my donation will go to the charity/organization?"

    100% of your donation will go to the organization/charity

### Extending The Session

In order to extend the session, you will first need to receive an [extension request](requests.en.md#extension-request) from the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer). To extend the session, [accept the extension request](requests.en.md#accepting-an-extension-request).

### Ending The Session

Tap on the **"End Session"** button to end the session.

#### Ending The Session In The First 15 Minutes

If you have ended the session in the first 15 minutes after the session started, you will be paid the minimum amount (*the minimum price that can be set for an expression*).

#### Ending The Session In The Last 15 Minutes

If you have ended the session in the first 15 minutes after the session started, you will be paid the full amount (*the price you have set for the expression*).

#### Ending The Session In The Middle

If you have ended the session in the first 15 minutes after the session started, you will be paid by the minutes (*the price you have set for the expression divided by 60, and multiplied by the duration of the session*).

### Rating The Explorer

Once you end the session, you will be given the option to rate the [explorer](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) and the [session](../../Features/sessions.en.md).

!!! info "Why can't I see a rating?"

    The rating percentage (the percentage of people who liked the [expression](expressions.en.md)/[expresser](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#expresser)) will show up once the [expresser](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#expresser)/[expression](expressions.en.md) has been rated more than or equal to 10 times. [Expressions](expressions.en.md)/[expressers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#expresser) who have not been rated more than or equal to 10 times will have the **:material-sprout:** icon instead of the rating percentage.
