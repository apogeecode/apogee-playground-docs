# Requests

On Apogee Playground, [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) send a request to [expressers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#expressers) to:

- Have a [session](../../Features/sessions.en.md)
- Extend a [session](../../Features/sessions.en.md)
- Book a [session](../../Features/sessions.en.md) for a later time

[Expressers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#expressers) can accept or reject these requests.

!!! warning

    Your app must be open in the foreground for you to be able to receive an instant request

## Instant Requests

When you receive an instant request, a box will pop up at the bottom of the screen displaying the requested [expression](expressions.en.md), duration, and the person who requested. You will have 90 seconds to accept/reject the request. Upon acceptance, you will be redirected to pre-session page where you will be able to [communicate with the explorer](having_session.en.md#communicating), [navigate to explorer's location](having_session.en.md#navigating), and [start the session](having_session.en.md#starting-a-session).
