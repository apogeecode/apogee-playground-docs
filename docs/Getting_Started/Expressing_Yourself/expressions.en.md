# Expressions

Expressions are the activities that you enjoy doing, that you are willing to share with others in exchange for money.

You can add as many expressions as you would like, however you can only activate maximum 3 of them at a time. Active expressions will be visible to the [Explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) for them to [instantly request](requests.en.md#instant-request) when you are online, and for them to [book for later](requests.en.md#booking-request) when you are online OR offline.

Expressions have 2 prices you can set:

- Physical price per hour
- Virtual price per 30 minutes (optional)
