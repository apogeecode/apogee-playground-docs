# Expressions

Expressions are the activities that you enjoy doing, that you are willing to share with others in exchange for money.

You can add as many expressions as you would like, however you can only activate maximum 3 of them at a time. Active expressions will be visible to the [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) for them to [instantly request](requests.en.md#instant-request) when you are online, and for them to [book for later](requests.en.md#booking-request) when you are online OR offline.

Expressions have 2 prices you can set:

- Physical price per hour
- Virtual price per 30 minutes (optional)

### Enabling Multi-Explorer

You can let multiple [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) to join a [session](../../Features/sessions.en.md) by enabling [multi-explorer](../../Features/sessions.en.md#multi-explorer). It is possible to:

- Limit the number of [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) who can join (*from 2 [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) to 5 [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer)*)
- Give a certain percentage of discount to groups

1. While [adding](#adding-an-expression)/[editing](#editing-an-expression) an expression, check the **":material-checkbox-marked: Allow multi-explorer"** box
2. Enter the maximum number of [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) (min 2, max 5)
3. Optionally, enter the discount amount to be applied when the maximum number of [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) join

#### How The Discounts Work

When the [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) join as a group, meaning one of the [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) pay for all others, you can give them a discount. The total discount percentage is calculated using the following formula:

| **Description**                                   | **Variable** |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Total Discount Percentage                         | $y$          |
| Maximum Discount Percentage (The one you set)     | $\alpha$     |
| Maximum Explorer Count (The one you set)          | $\beta$      |
| Number of Explorers That Join The Session         | $n$          |

$y=(\alpha/\beta)*n$

**Here's an example:**

You set the **maximum explorer count** ($\beta$) to 4, and the **maximum discount percentage** ($\alpha$) to 20. A group of 3 [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) join the session.

Using the formula:

$(20/4)*3=15\%$

The total discount percentage is 15%, as 3 [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) out of 4 joined. If 2 [explorers](../../Features/user_modes.en.md#explorer) joined instead of 3, then the total discount percentage would be 10%, vice versa.
