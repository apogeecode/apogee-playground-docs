# Choosing Your Mode

There are two modes, *or user modes*, on Apogee Playground: [Express](#express) and [Explore](#explore). You can choose your mode any time, or every time you open the app.

## Express

If you would like to express yourself and do what you love/feel like to earn money, this is the mode for you! People who are interested in what you are doing (your expression) will be paying to spend time with you. You will be able to find and connect with people with the same interests.

???+ question "No ideas?"

    Try asking yourself: **"What are the things that make me lose the track of time?"**. If you are still unsure, you can try the [Explore](#explore) mode to get more ideas.

    You can also follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/playapogee/){:target="_blank"} to explore more ideas.

## Explore

If you are looking to find interesting people or people who can help you in any way, this is the mode for you! You will be paying people on an hourly basis.
